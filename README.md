## Overview

If you want to spare some time and just test it out, I've provided a bit of trained data that can be used.

In general the game at a basic level is actually fairly easy to grasp, though for it to be able to function in a competitive aspect a ton of factors will have to come into play but the baseline follows as such:

- There are resources, minerals and gases, you use these resources to build buildings and units.
- Certain buildings and units are require pre-requisites to exist before they can be constructed.
- There are 3 playable "races", each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
- For this project, **Protoss** is what we're going with, only since it looks cool.
- Building an unit names vary between the races, but relatively similar in concept.
- The building and units order goes as shown:
